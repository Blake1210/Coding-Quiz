In this challenge I created a quiz about Javascript that has a timer, pulls questions from other JS files, and will give you a score based on how quickly you finished the test and how many questions you got right.

At the end of the quiz, you will be prompted to save your initials with this score that will be saved in a highscore html. This page can be viewed at any time and you can clear that data if you want to.
